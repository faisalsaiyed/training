Git Bash - Git Push

uninstall git bash
restart your computer
install git bash, select native windows secure channel library at https transport backend
installed gitbash

go to C/Users/"your_user_name"/create a folder(e.g. data)
so the path will be like C/Users/"your_user_name"/data

launch git bash
type pwd - it will show you the path: it will be like C/Users/"your_user_name"
type cd data (you created data folder), you will be now in that directory
to check again, type pwd - it will show the path - C/Users/"your_user_name"/data
(go to github.com and copy your repo link)

type git clone and paste your link
like: git clone https://github.com/"username"/"reponame".git
(It will be cloning and you will see some lines and "done" at the end of the lines.
now you can see the folder matching with your repo in data folder

type cd "folder name" (new folder after cloning in data folder)
in my case it is: cd training/

make sure again with command pwd - it will show you the path C/Users/"your_user_name"/data/"new folder name"

now you can use these commands
echo "type here some message" > filename (enter)

git status (enter) (you will see the file name in red font)

git add filename (enter) (to add the file)

git status (enter) (you will see the file name in green font)

git commit -m "any message" (enter)

git push (worked for me, no need to use command prompt or use config command)

try this and reply.
